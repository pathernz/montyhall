#'   The Monty Hall Problem

#' @description
#'  There are three doors, behind one there is a car. Behind the other two there are goats.
#' Can you find the car and win the game? 
#' @details
#'   The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's
#'   Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant
#'   to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two 
#'   have goats. 
#'   Once the contestant has selected a door, the host
#'   opens one of the remaining two doors to reveal a goat. and then the contestant is
#'   The contestant at this point must now make another choice: 
#'   Should they keep their selection the same, or choose the remaining door? 
#'   Fortunately, with statistics and an R simulation we can figure out which option
#'   gives them the highest chance of finding the car!  
#'
#' @param ... no arguments are used by the function create_game().
#' 
#' @return The function returns a length 3 character vector
#'   indicating the positions of goats and the car.
#'
#' @examples
#'   create_game()
#'
#' @export
create_game <- function()
{
    a.game <- sample( x=c("goat","goat","car"), size=3, replace=F )
    return( a.game )
} 



#' @title
#'   Have the game "player" select the door
#'
#' @description
#'   select_door() represents the player selecting a door numbered 1 through 3.
#'
#' @details
#'   The function generates a random pick between 1 and 3. This represents the
#'   contestant's initial door choice.
#'
#' @param
#'   No arguments are used by the function.
#'
#' @return
#'   The function returns a variable `a.pick` containing either the integer 1, 2, or 3.
#'
#' @examples
#'   select_door()
#'
#' @export
select_door <- function( )
{
  doors <- c(1,2,3) 
  a.pick <- sample( doors, size=1 )
  return( a.pick )  # number between 1 and 3
}



#' @title
#'   Have the host open a door not picked by the player
#'
#' @description
#'   open_goat_door() represents the host opening a door behind which sits a goat.
#'   This door must not be the same door that the player picked.
#'
#' @details
#'   The function generates another number between 1 and 3, but this time it must
#'   not be the number the player selected AND it must correspond to a goat.
#'
#' @param
#'   This function takes the `game` and `a.pick` variables as arguments to ensure
#'   that the result is not the player's selected door.
#'
#' @return
#'   This function returns an `opened.door` variable containing an integer between 1 and 3.
#'
#' @examples
#'   this.game <- create_game()
#'   this.pick <- select_door()
#'   open_goat_door(this.game, this.pick)
#'
#' @export
open_goat_door <- function( game, a.pick )
{
   doors <- c(1,2,3)
   # if contestant selected car,
   # randomly select one of two goats 
   if( game[ a.pick ] == "car" )
   { 
     goat.doors <- doors[ game != "car" ] 
     opened.door <- sample( goat.doors, size=1 )
   }

   { 
     opened.door <- doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]

   return( opened.door ) # number between 1 and 3
}

#'   The host offers the player the option to swap their door
#'
#' @description
#'   change_door() represents the host offering the contestant the option to
#'   swap their door selection to the only unopened remaining door.
#'
#' @details
#'   This function takes a value for a `stay` variable, which represents the
#'   player either sticking with their initial choice or switching doors. It
#'   outputs the final door selection.
#'
#' @param
#'   This function takes in a `stay` variable, the `opened.door` variable, and
#'   the initial `a.pick` variable.
#'
#' @return
#'   This function returns `final.pick`, an integer between 1 and 3.
#'
#' @examples
#'   goat.door <- open_goat_door(this.game, this.pick)
#'   change_door(stay=F, goat.door, this.pick)
#'
#' @export
change_door <- function( stay=T, opened.door, a.pick )
{
   doors <- c(1,2,3) 
   
   if( stay )

     final.pick <- a.pick
   }
   if( ! stay )
   {
     final.pick <- doors[ doors != opened.door & doors != a.pick ] 
   }
  
   return( final.pick )  # number between 1 and 3
}

#'   This function determines whether or not the player won a car
#'
#' @description
#'   This function checks the player's final selection and identifies whether it
#'   matches the door that has the car.
#'
#' @details
#'   The function takes the final selection and the `game` variable and compares
#'   the selection to the prize behind that door. If and only if it's a car, the
#'   player wins.
#'
#' @param
#'   This function takes the arguments `final.pick` (returned in the previous
#'   function) and `game`.
#'
#' @return
#'   The function returns the string "WIN" or "LOSE".
#'
#' @examples
#'   selection <- change_door(stay=F, goat.door, this.pick)
#'   determine_winner(selection, this.game)
#'
#' @export
determine_winner <- function( final.pick, game )
{
   if( game[ final.pick ] == "car" )
   {
      return( "WIN" )
   }
   if( game[ final.pick ] == "goat" )

      return( "LOSE" )

#'   The full play_game function runs through each previous function to simulate an entire Monty Hall game scenario.
#'
#' @description
#'   This function simulates a full game so we can check results for both the
#'   stay and switch strategies.
#'
#' @details
#'   The function creates the `game` variable with the prizes and doors,
#'   simulates the player's selection, runs the scenarios where the player
#'   swaps and stays, then determines whether they won or lost, storing the
#'   results in a `results` variable.
#'
#' @param
#'   This function takes no arguments.
#'
#' @return
#'   The function returns `game.results`, which shows whether the player stayed
#'   or switched and whether they won or lost that game.

#'   Plays n games of Monty Hall
#'
#' @description
#'   Plays `n` games of Monty Hall with both strategies (stay or switch) and records the results.
#'
#' @details
#'   This function runs the previous function `n` times and records all the
#'   results by trying both strategies. This allows us to check across many
#'   runs which strategy is best.
#'
#' @param
#'   `n` â€” an integer representing how many times we want to play the game.
#'
#' @return
#'   This function returns `results.df`, a list of results for each game simulated.

#' @description
#'   Simulates beginning the game.
